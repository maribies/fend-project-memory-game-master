# How to contribute

The files in this repository were adapted by me as practice as a Udacity student. Because I need to write the majority of the code myself for submission, pull requests (most likely) will _not_ be merged into the project.

However, after I have submitted for peer review and passed, I will still work to improve my code. At which time, pull requests will be considered. As a student, I value learning from others and would appreciate any contributions made to optimize the code and performance as long as detailed explanation and comments are given to allow for learning and understanding. Thanks.
