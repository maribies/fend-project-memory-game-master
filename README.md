## Overview

This is my version of the Udacity Memory Game project. I have practiced converting this project from starter code and a static project to an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To see the starter code visit - https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game.

## Contributing

This repository is for me to develop my skills as a Udacity student. Therefore, I will most likely not accept pull requests. (At least not until after my submission has been reviewed for completion towards my nanodegree program.)
