## Overview

This is my version of the Udacity Memory Game project. I have practiced converting this project from starter code and a static project to an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To see the starter code visit - https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game.

## How it Works

A take on the classic memory game - Concentration- the player is presented with 16 cards, face down, randomly shuffled, each with one match. The player selects two cards to see at a time, in hopes of matching two symbols. At the start of the game, a timer begins, as well as a move counter, tracking progress as the player matches each card pair. A star rating is given, with three stars won if the player achieves all matches under 32 moves, 2 stars if matched under 42 moves, and 1 star any additional attempts at matching the cards. At anytime, the player can reshuffle and reset the entire board. The player wins when all 16 cards are matched, and a congratulations message appears and the player is asked if s/he wants to play again.

## Contributing

This repository is for me to develop my skills as a Udacity student. Therefore, I will most likely not accept pull requests. (At least not until after my submission has been reviewed for completion towards my nanodegree program.)

## Code dependancies
The starter code provided uses Google fonts and Font Awesome icons.
And of course, JavaScript. Plain vanilla JavaScript. For now.
